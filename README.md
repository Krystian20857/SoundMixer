# Sound Mixer Project
Sound Mixer is a utility device designed to control volume of applications and audio devices. Audio control take place by sliders, other functions like muting, skipping/playing tracks are handled by buttons. Because controling volume of devices/audio session is platform specified the device itself cannot do it. Piece that expands capabilities of device is software running on pc which store all configuration and handles incoming data from device. Device itself can do nothing without software :). Using external software allows to even more expand capabilities of device by e.g. plugin system, etc.
